        <h1>Report: Dietary Analysis and Optimization Version 1</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>For almost a year, I've been diligently tracking my dietary data using the Chronometer website. This data collection process is rooted in precision, as I measure everything I consume in grams. To enhance the accuracy and relevance of the data, I used R and R Studio for the analysis.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="data-collection-and-cleaning">
        <h2>Data Collection and Cleaning</h2>
        <p>I began the analysis journey by downloading comprehensive dietary data from the Chronometer website. The data includes detailed information about nutrient intake, providing an extensive record of my dietary habits over time.</p>

        <section id="data-cleaning">
            <h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
            <p>Utilizing R and the dplyr and tidyr libraries, I meticulously cleaned the raw data. The data cleaning process encompassed the following tasks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Removal of empty rows and any extraneous information.</li>
                <li>Imputation of missing values with zeros, ensuring data consistency.</li>
                <li>Proper structuring of data to maintain data integrity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>R Code for Data Cleaning</h3>
            <pre class="code-box"><code>
                # Title: Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values in CSV File

        # Introduction:
        # In data analysis and preparation, one crucial step is cleaning the dataset to ensure it is free of errors, inconsistencies, and missing values. In this code example, we demonstrate how to clean a CSV file, specifically addressing the removal of empty rows, replacing missing values with zeros, and filtering rows based on a minimum value in the second column.
        
        # Code Overview:
        
        # Library Loading:
        # The code starts by loading the dplyr library, which is essential for data manipulation in R.
        library(dplyr)
        library(tidyr)
        
        # CSV File Reading:
        # The CSV file, located at "dailysummary.csv," is read into the nutrient_data data frame using read.csv(). The option stringsAsFactors = FALSE ensures that character columns are not converted into factors.
        nutrient_data <- read.csv("dailysummary.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
        
        # Header Row Preservation:
        # The first row of the dataset, typically containing column names or headers, is stored in the header_row variable.
        header_row <- nutrient_data[1, ]
        
        # Removing Header Row:
        # To facilitate cleaning, the header row is removed from the nutrient_data data frame. This allows us to apply data cleaning operations to the remaining rows without affecting the column names.
        nutrient_data <- nutrient_data[-1, ]
        
        # Filtering Empty Rows:
        # Using rowSums(), the code identifies rows where any column (except the first) is not empty. Rows with empty values in all columns (except the first) are removed from the dataset.
        nutrient_data <- nutrient_data[rowSums(!is.na(nutrient_data[, -1])) > 0, ]
        
        # Restoring Header Row:
        # After cleaning the data, the header row is added back to the cleaned_nutrient_data data frame using rbind(). This ensures that the cleaned data retains the original column names.
        cleaned_nutrient_data <- rbind(header_row, nutrient_data)
        
        # Replacing Missing Values with 0:
        # Any remaining missing values (NA) in the cleaned_nutrient_data data frame are replaced with zeros (0). This step ensures consistency in data types and facilitates further analysis.
        cleaned_nutrient_data[is.na(cleaned_nutrient_data)] <- 0
        
        # Filtering Rows Based on Second Column (Energy):
        # Now, let's filter rows where the value in the second column (assuming it represents "Calories") is less than 800.
        cleaned_nutrient_data <- cleaned_nutrient_data %>%
          filter(as.numeric(cleaned_nutrient_data[, 2]) >= 800)
        
        # Reshaping Data to Long Format
        long_data <- cleaned_nutrient_data %>%
        pivot_longer(cols = -Date, names_to = "Nutrient", values_to = "Value")
        
        # Saving Long Data as the Second Sheet
        #write.csv(long_data, "dailysummary_Long.csv", row.names = FALSE)
        
        
        # Saving Cleaned Data:
        # Finally, the cleaned dataset is saved as a new CSV file named "dailysummary_Cleaned.csv" using write.csv(). The option row.names = FALSE prevents the inclusion of row numbers in the saved file.
        #write.csv(cleaned_nutrient_data, "dailysummary_Cleaned.csv", row.names = FALSE)
        
        
        # Calculate and save the average for each column
        column_averages <- colMeans(cleaned_nutrient_data[-1])
        average_data <- data.frame(Nutrient = names(column_averages), Average = column_averages)
        
        # Save the average data as "column_averages.csv"
        write.csv(average_data, "column_averages.csv", row.names = FALSE)
        
        # Create a third CSV with headers for RDA input
        # You can manually input RDA values in this CSV
        header_with_rda <- data.frame(Nutrient = colnames(cleaned_nutrient_data))
        write.csv(header_with_rda, "RDA_input.csv", row.names = FALSE)
        
        
        # Conclusion:
        # Data cleaning is an essential part of data preparation for analysis and modeling. This code demonstrates how to remove empty rows, preserve the header, replace missing values with zeros, and filter rows based on a minimum value in the second column of a CSV file using R and the dplyr library. The resulting cleaned dataset is now ready for further analysis, ensuring data quality and integrity.

        <h2>Data Visualization</h2>
        <p>In the pursuit of gaining insights from the data, I harnessed the power of Tableau to create compelling visualizations. Visual representations included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Line charts depicting daily nutrient intake trends over the tracking period.</li>
            <li>Bar charts providing comparisons between my dietary nutrient intake and the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) and Recommended Maximum Allowance (RMA).</li>
