        <h2>About Me</h2>

          
        <p>I'm Luis, a passionate data analytics enthusiast with a background that started as a hobby back in 2012. It was then that I began programming, my journey initiated with Lua on Roblox.</p>
        <p>Fast forward to today, and I find myself deciphering the ever-evolving landscape of virtual reality (VR) with the help of Unity. My AS degree in Computer Programming and Analysis laid the groundwork for my technical skills, which I now leverage to create immersive VR experiences and explore the limitless possibilities of this exciting space.</p>
        <p>As a data enthusiast, I see data as more than just numbers; it's a way to tell stories and make informed decisions. Whether I'm crunching data or attemting to craft VR worlds, my goal remains the same: to blend creativity and technology to bring ideas to life.</p>
        <p>Outside the digital realm, I enjoy building custom computers and managing my own homelab, including my Unraid server. These hands-on pursuits provide the perfect balance to my digital adventures.</p>
        <p>Join me on my journey as I continue to dive deeper into the VR world, decode data narratives, and explore the endless possibilities that technology and creativity offer.</p>

                <p>For nearly a year, I've diligently tracked my dietary data using the Chronometer website. With a focus on precision, I measured every consumption in grams. Using R and R Studio, I conducted a thorough analysis of this data, which includes nutrient intake details, to gain valuable insights.
